Faithful to the Roman Catholic tradition and inspired by Gospel values, we prepare students to be lifelong learners and to lead lives of integrity.

PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
In the tradition of Holy Cross, a Notre Dame College Prep education emphasizes the formation of the hearts and minds of young men. As the Congregation’s founder, Blessed Basil Moreau, C.S.C. stated, “the mind will not be cultivated at the expense of the heart.” This approach to education promotes the development of the whole person. We believe such an experience is critical, since society has a great need for people who lead their lives possessing intellectual curiosity, strong moral character, and social responsibility based upon Christian values. We further believe the quality of education is dependent on the quality of the people engaged in this purpose. Consequently, Notre Dame educators are people of faith who motivate, inspire, and lead the student towards academic excellence while fostering critical thinking, creativity, and leadership. Finally, we believe this education takes place best within a Christ-centered community of faith.",Over 500 students,Approximately 280 students per year.,All boys,"$11,850.00",Yes,Yes,"Big Shoulders Fund, LINK Unlimited, HFS Chicago, Highsight, Madonna Foundation, Chicago Lights",http://www.nddons.org,Yes,"PACE: 250, 270, 410",Yellow,"Milwaukee District North (MD-N), Union Pacific Northwest (UP-NW)",Yes - for all students,"Post-High School Counseling, Support for Learning Differences, Tutoring, Mental Health Counseling","AP Biology, AP English, AP Computer Science, AP Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Studies, AP Physics, AP United States History, AP World History, AP Psychology, AP Government and Politics, AP Italian, AP Spanish, AP Studio Art, Summer School, Dual Enrollment or Credit, Service Learning","AP Biology, AP English, AP Computer Science, AP Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Studies, AP Physics, AP United States History, AP World History, AP Psychology, AP Government and Politics, AP Italian, AP Spanish, AP Studio Art","Drama, Choir/Chorus, National Honor Society, STEM Clubs, Coding, Robotics, Art, Band/Orchestra, Foreign Language, Student Government, Business/Entrepreneurship","Basketball, Football, Flag Football, Softball, Baseball, Track and Field, Cross Country, Hockey, Wrestling, Cheerleading/Dance Team, Swimming, Soccer, Volleyball, Golf, Bowling, Lacrosse, Tennis","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oJ9HUuZzlrDb8aQOG8AxmiUYxy-RR7t8, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-w4bpQtxdQ2JarQK5iyrlk-xw0uWyNm, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uhPMVnB-P8aavuY0TWs0d0vSlnHhaWsh","http://www.nddons.org/s/1034/16/index.aspx?sid=1034&gid=1&pgid=1846&cid=6871&post_id=0
